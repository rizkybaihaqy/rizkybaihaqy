Do you like React Hooks? me too, let's team up.

I like my code to be easy to understand and easy to read. Making the code readable like English is a satisfaction for me.

I had an internship as full stack web developer at EEC Indonesia and as software engineer at Nodeflux.

I'm currently trying to finish my studies at the University of Diponegoro. It's not that I'm lazy but I have a lot of things i want to do before my student status is over.
